# GameThreeInLine

This is the game on the checkered field, the goal of which is to be the first to occupy three cells in a row.



Based on rajeevkumarsingh project, changed for my needs.

Created by rajeevkumarsingh on 24/07/17 - was in every original file.

# Rules

Two players take turns marking the sides of the squares. 
Who painted the last edge of the square paints the square in his own color. 
The one who builds three squares in a row is the winner.
